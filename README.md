# WPI CS 3733 - Hospital Information Kiosk Software

## Background
Over the course of one month, I worked with 9 other students to develop an application for kiosks at the Brigham and Women's Hospital near Boston, Massachusetts. The software was intended to be used by staff, patients and visitors alike, and contains a variety of features for improving the hospital experience.

## Main Features
* **Pathfinding** - Similar to other mapping software, users can enter two locations in the hospital and get directions between them.
* **Services** - Users can request a variety of services, including laundry, security, repairs/sanitiation, and translators.
* **Admin controls** - Hospital staff can access relevant maintainence features, such as blocking off areas for cleaning or managing service requests.
* **Chatbot** - The chatbot service can intelligently answer questions about map locations, kiosk features, or hospital policies.
* **Analytics** - Statistics about kiosk usage and popular requests can be viewed by admin users.
* **Textual directions** - In addition to viewing directions on a map, users can scan a QR code to receive step-by-step directions in plaintext form.

## Contributions
I was on the UI subteam, and mostly focused on the interactive map and tools that supported it. I aimed to replicate the experience of using Google Maps, with intuitive navigation controls and easy-to-understand visual feedback.
